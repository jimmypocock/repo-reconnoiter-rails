  # IP BLOCKLIST TESTS (Rack::Attack)
  #--------------------------------------

  # Note: IP blocking tests are skipped because Rack::Attack initializes
  # the blocklist at boot time from ENV["BLOCKED_IPS"].
  # Changing ENV vars during tests doesn't update Rack::Attack's cache.
  #
  # These features are verified by:
  # 1. Manual testing: BLOCKED_IPS="1.2.3.4" bin/rails server
  # 2. Rake tasks: bin/rails ips:test[1.2.3.4]
  # 3. Unit tests for the ENV parsing logic (if needed)
  #
  # For full integration testing of IP blocking, you'd need to:
  # - Restart Rails between tests (slow)
  # - Mock Rack::Attack's cache (fragile)
  # - Test at a different level (Rack middleware unit test)

  # test "blocked IPs receive 403 Forbidden" do
  #   # Skipped - requires Rack::Attack reinitialization
  # end

  # test "non-blocked IPs can access API with valid key" do
  #   # Skipped - requires Rack::Attack reinitialization
  # end
end
